# Imbalanced Classification
Imbalanced classification is a supervised learning problem where one class outnumbers other class by a large proportion.
### Dataset
In this project, we will use the US census-income data set from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/census-income-mld/)

**Goal of this project:**
Predict the income class of US population using an imbalanced dataset

I apply different sampling techniques for handling imbalanced, perfrom predictions using the out-of-sample (test) dataset and finally do performance evaluation of the techniques
